This was my first foray into web development, and it taught me many valuable skills, such as how to set up a web development environment, or how to use Javascript/HTML/CSS frameworks. Although this website is 'finished' for now, I am planning on continuing to update it and expand it in the future.",

        description: "I created this application as a capstone project for my CS 3140 class. Although meant to be a group project, I completed it entirely by myself. Over the course of the semester, I had learned many different things about software development, and the point of this project was to combine all of them into a single, full-stack project. A small side note, I chose to create a GUI for the project instead of using a command line interface, so I received a 120% on it as my grade, which is something that I'm very proud of.",
